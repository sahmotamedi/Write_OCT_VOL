# Write_OCT_VOL
A MATLAB script to write *.vol files as formatted by Heidelberg Engineering spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) device.

Heildelberg Engineering (HE) is one of the most dominent SD-OCT manufacturers for retinal imaging (there is a SD-OCT from Heidelberg Engineering in the International Space Station [(ISS)](http://www.octnews.org/articles/5179109/heidelberg-spectralis-oct-eye-examinations-in-spac/)!). SD-OCT images from HE are usually saved in an standard format named E2E, though HE has another file format to save OCT images, *.vol format, which it has only given to some research groups. The code to read *.vol files have been written, and now this project consists of a MATLAB code (*.m file) to write *.vol files. 

The Write_OCT_VOL might be useful if someone wants to modify OCT images or their information (cropping images, changing the segmetation, etc) and afterwards save them again in the .vol format.

## Usage

To run this code, MATLAB R2012b or later is needed, without the need to install any additional MATLAB Toolboxes. An instruction on how to call the write_vol function in MATLAB and more details about this fuction are provided at the beginning of the write_vol.m file.
